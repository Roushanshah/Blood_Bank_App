# About Blood Bank
The Blood Bank project is designed to manage and track the availability of blood donations. The main goal is to store information about users who have donated blood and categorize this information based on specific blood groups. The applicationâ€™s front end is built using XML for defining the UI components, ensuring a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through the features. Core Java is employed to handle the logic and backend operations, such as managing user sessions, data retrieval, and processing transactions. The integration with Firebase enables real-time updates and notifications, making it easier to manage donor and recipient information, track donations, and ensure the availability of different blood type.
